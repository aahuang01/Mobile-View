                <!--Yayyy Nishinoya is my favorite character in Haikyuu because he reminds me a lot of myself! Both of us are liberos, we're
                very chaotic and loud, and we have very strong values that we stick by. Also we're both really short lol. He's an absolute
                beast when it comes to digging hits and is the starting libero for Karasuno High School. They're currently at nationals right now!-->
                <p class="content" id="nis">
                Last but not least, my favorite character in Haikyuu: Yu Nishinoya! Sitting at about 5'3", he is Karasuno High School's starting
                libero and "Guardian Deity" for his exceptional defending skills. Personally, Nishinoya is my favorite character because he reminds
                me a lot of myself! Both of us play the same position, are relatively short, and have chaotic and loud personalities.
                </p>
                <p class="content" id="nisnis">
                Nishinoya is generally a very confident and energetic individual whose boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans always manages to
                cheer the team up, even if it seems like they might lose. However, when he gets serious during a game, his demeanor completely changes,
                juxtaposing his usual chaotic self to a person whose passion for saving every ball can be clearly seen. His desire to do everything in
                his power to provide the support that his team needs in any moment is what causes everyone on the team to greatly respect him! I
                love him for being probably the #1 most chaotic character in all of Haikyuu.
